# Line3D

This project implements a *linerizer*: Similar to a rasterizer, but extracts visible polygon outlines instead of visible pixels from a 3D scene.

This is useful for when the display hardware is an actual vector screen (like a [Vectrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) or a [Tektronix 4010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektronix_4010)).


## TODO

- [x] Load 3D model
- [x] Fly-through camera
- [x] Render lines with projection
- [ ] Clip lines against polygons
- [ ] Export the line list per frame
